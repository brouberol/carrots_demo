"""carrots URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Add an import:  from blog import urls as blog_urls
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^blog/', include(blog_urls))

from django.conf.urls import include, url
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^polls/$', 'polls.views.index'),
    url(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/$', 'polls.views.detail'),
    url(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/results/$', 'polls.views.results'),
    url(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/vote/$', 'polls.views.vote'),
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
]

# Note: maybe mention that we could also have a urls.py file in the polls
# app, and include the polls.urls module here, to make apps truly independant.
